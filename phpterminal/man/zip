NAME
       zip - package and compress (archive) files

SYNOPSIS
       zip [OPTION]... ZIPFILE FILE...

OPTIONS
       -r
              Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:

                     zip -r foo.zip foo

              In  this case, all the files and directories in foo are saved in a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with names starting with ".", since the recursion does not use
              the shell's file-name substitution mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific subset of the files in directory foo and its subdirectories,  use  the  -i  option  to
              specify the pattern of files to be included.  You should not use -r with the name ".*", since that matches ".."  which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (probably
              not what was intended).

              Multiple source directories are allowed as in

                     zip -r foo.zip foo1 foo2

              which first zips up foo1 and then foo2, going down each directory.
